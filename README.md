## Cache API demo

A demo I made to learn (and help others learn) the [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache). 

The app creates a UI to help you explore how the Cache API works.

## Getting started

Once you've cloned the repo, start a local server in the project directory and navigate to the appropriate local host port (e.g. http://localhost:8000/).
